    <p>An organization creates a new account and provide data source (URL) and fetch type. Platform periodically pool data from the source, parse and store them in the database. Admin should approve organization by setting approved to true. The approved organization can access API configurator to set up field types and write a short description of a field. If oc_sync is set to the true platform will push organization data to Organicity (set LOCAL_OC_URL environment variable to point at your local OC Site). Organization data is available at endpoint http://localhost/api/v1/organizations/:organization_name</p>
